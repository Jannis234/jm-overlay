#Welcome!

It looks like you have found my personal portage overlay.
This overlay contains mostly random ebuilds that might be useful for somebody.
If you want to use one (or more) of these ebuilds, you can add this overlay using layman by downloading "layman.xml" and placing it in "/etc/layman/overlays/".
Alternatively, you can clone this git repository and add it to PORTDIR_OVERLAY in your make.conf
